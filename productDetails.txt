We looked into the future and it's gonna be comfy. Featuring a "point-loaded" Air unit (cushioning that forms to your every step), the Air Max Scorpion Flyknit delivers a futuristic sensation. And because looks count, we've crafted the upper from incredibly soft chenille-like fabric.


The Future of Comfort

Built around the concept of "point-loading" (designer jargon that simply means great responsiveness and improved comfort), the Air cushioning works in tandem with other components to deliver a new underfoot sensation.


Responsible Style

The expressive upper pairs super-soft chenille-style fabric with incredibly lightweight Flyknit, striking a balance between fashion and sport. To top it off, we've made it from at least 20% recycled material by weight so you can look good while doing good.


Traction to Get You Places

A generative design pattern on the outsole improves traction on a variety of surfaces so you can focus on your journey.

Nike Air Max Origins

Revolutionary Air technology first made its way into Nike footwear in 1978. In 1987, the Air Max 1 debuted with visible Air technology in its heel, allowing fans more than just the feel of Air cushioning—suddenly they could see it. Since then, next-generation Air Max shoes have become a hit with athletes and collectors by offering striking colour combinations and reliable, lightweight cushioning.
