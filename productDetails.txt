You lace up in pursuit of new personal goals. Let the Nike Quest 5 help you reach those aspirations. This neutral sneaker gives you a smooth, comfortable ride with plenty of traction. We focused on our foam, adding more cushioning for a better transition from heel to toe.


Cool, Light, Fast

Mesh throughout the upper adds a lightweight, breathable feel. The mesh was placed in key zones based on runner feedback, providing you with cooling where it counts.


Lace Up, Support Up

Feel the stability with the midfoot fitband. It works with your laces, keeping your foot more secure the tighter your laces are. A translucent material shows off the components at the midfoot.


Run Hard with a Soft Feel

Super-soft foam through the midsole helps cushion your foot with every step. The increased height means a softer sensation as you run.


Traction for the Long Haul

The rubber outsole has the traction to keep your feet gripped to the pavement.


More Benefits

Super-soft padding and cushioning on the collar help keep your ankle comfortable.
Skins at the toes and eyelets offer durability.

description:The longer LeBron's legendary career continues, the more his game needs a design that doesn't weigh him down, yet can still control all that sublime power. So, we've created our lightest LeBron model but with the kind of bankable support that can help you stay in front of your opponent with the game on the line. Full-length Max Air cushioning helps you take off and land confidently, while lightweight mesh blends with containment cables to help keep you locked in for four quarters or more. This version is made for outdoor-court use with its extra-durable rubber outsole.


Cushioned Comfort

A full-length Max Air unit in a low-profile midsole is combined with a foam wrap-up for support when you're moving in lateral directions. The Air is specifically placed in the forefoot to help reduce weight and increase responsiveness. It helps with impact absorption while supporting the smooth transition from heel to toe. Also, it provides side-to-side stability and helps harness and direct your force.


Reinforced Materials

Breathable mesh provides a lightweight, conforming fit in the upper, from the webbing that harnesses your forefoot to the external moulded pieces that help lock in your heel. Reinforced stitching along the sides helps the shoe fit snugly for full-foot containment.


Aggressive Traction

The rubber outsole is split and partially cut out under the arch to help it bend and flex while helping reduce its overall weight. A classic herringbone pattern adds durable traction.

Instantly tilt the pitch in the bold design of the Superfly 9 Academy MG. It's loaded with a Zoom Air unit and flexible NikeSkin up top for exceptional touch, so you can dominate in the waning minutes of a match—when it matters most. Fast is in the Air.


Welcome to the Pitch, Zoom

For the first time in our history, Nike has developed an all-new Zoom Air unit. It sits in the plate and provides an additional level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move faster on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going by defenders.


Drive Your Speed

The speed cage inside of the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding additional weight for optimal lockdown.


Dig In, Take Off

Unique traction pattern offers super-charged traction with quick release to create separation.


Improved Fit

Flyknit wraps your ankle in soft, stretchy fabric for a secure feel. A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better lockdown in the heel.


Barefoot Feel

The upper has NikeSkin, a soft and flexible mesh material linked together by a thin coating. It helps provide ball control and truly gives you a feeling of barefoot football.

Revamped Upper

A breathable, lightweight upper has a comfortable, sock-like feel with a 7/8-length inner sleeve and provides easy entry. Plush foam around the collar provides comfort and support around your ankle.


Stability for Strength

The wide heel creates a solid base for lifting. A softer foam core cushions your foot, while a firmer outer layer is durable and stable. Wide internal webbing distributes pressure around your midfoot for a comfortable yet secure feel during sudden stops and quick cuts.


Move Freely

Nike Free technology in the forefoot creates flexibility for agility moves like burpees, planks and sprints. Stretch around the collar lets your foot move naturally as you burst, cut and brake.


More Benefits

Moulded heel clip offers support.
Webbing eyelets offer dynamic containment.
Rubber tread in high-wear areas gives you durable traction.

We looked into the future and it's gonna be comfy. Featuring a "point-loaded" Air unit (cushioning that forms to your every step), the Air Max Scorpion Flyknit delivers a futuristic sensation. And because looks count, we've crafted the upper from incredibly soft chenille-like fabric.


The Future of Comfort

Built around the concept of "point-loading" (designer jargon that simply means great responsiveness and improved comfort), the Air cushioning works in tandem with other components to deliver a new underfoot sensation.


Responsible Style

The expressive upper pairs super-soft chenille-style fabric with incredibly lightweight Flyknit, striking a balance between fashion and sport. To top it off, we've made it from at least 20% recycled material by weight so you can look good while doing good.


Traction to Get You Places

A generative design pattern on the outsole improves traction on a variety of surfaces so you can focus on your journey.

Nike Air Max Origins

Revolutionary Air technology first made its way into Nike footwear in 1978. In 1987, the Air Max 1 debuted with visible Air technology in its heel, allowing fans more than just the feel of Air cushioning—suddenly they could see it. Since then, next-generation Air Max shoes have become a hit with athletes and collectors by offering striking colour combinations and reliable, lightweight cushioning.
